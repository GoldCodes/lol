<h2 id="credits_terms">Terms &amp; Conditions for the Sale of Credits</h2>
<!-- 6-28-11 -->
<p>Please read these Terms carefully before purchasing Credits. By ordering any Credits, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>These Terms and Conditions for the Sale of Credits (the "<strong>Terms</strong>") govern the purchase or allocation to you, and use by you, of virtual credits ("<strong>Credits</strong>") which are made available for purchase by Miniclip SA on or via www.miniclip.com and certain related sub or affiliate sites (the "<strong>Site</strong>") and/or certain third party websites.</p>
<p>By clicking "I CONFIRM" in connection with a purchase of Credits:-</p>
<ul>
<li>you agree to be bound by these Terms;</li>
<li>you represent that you are an adult 18 years of age or older or, if under 18 years of age, that you have the consent of a parent or guardian and will provide their details if requested by Miniclip SA;</li>
<li>you agree to pay for the Credits at the indicated price, and you confirm that you are permitted to use the payment source that you have provided; and</li>
<li>you authorise Miniclip SA, or its designated payment processor, to charge the full amount to the payment source you have designated for the transaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>These Terms form part of, and incorporate, the general Terms and Conditions of Miniclip SA. However, in the event of any inconsistency between these Terms and the general Terms and Conditions of Miniclip SA, these Terms shall prevail.</p>
<h3>PURCHASE AND USE OF CREDITS</h3>
<p>Miniclip SA will from time to time offer to sell packages of Credits on or via the Miniclip.com website. Miniclip SA is entitled to change the purchase price for Credits at any time. At the time of purchase of Credits, you may be offered additional Credits free-of-charge. You may also, from time to time, be invited to participate in online marketing, surveys or campaigns on or via the Site in connection with which you may be offered additional Credits without additional charge. However, for the purposes of these Terms no distinction is made between paid-for and free-of-charge Credits.</p>
<p>Credits are limited licences to digital goods and do not constitute personal property and are not legal tender or currency of any kind. All Credits purchased by you are non-refundable. No interest is paid or earned on any Credits balance. Credits are not redeemable for any sum of money or monetary value from Miniclip SA unless otherwise expressly agreed in writing by Miniclip SA.</p>
<p>Unexpired Credits may be redeemed by you in order to acquire additional features, items, or benefits (collectively "<strong>Premium Items</strong>") within or in connection with certain games or applications made available to you on or via the Site ("<strong>Miniclip Games</strong>"). When you use Credits to acquire a Premium Item within a Miniclip Game, the relevant amount of Credits will automatically be deducted from your account.</p>
<p>The nature and duration of Premium Items varies between and within Miniclip Games. Some Premium Items may only be used for a limited number of uses or time within the relevant Miniclip Game(s). Credits will not in any circumstances be refunded to you in respect of any unused uses or unused time for use-limited or time-limited Premium Items. Miniclip SA may, without notifying you, vary the scope, variety and type of Premium Items. Miniclip SA has no obligation to make, or continue to make, any specific Premium Item that may or may not have been acquired by you available in or in connection with any Miniclip Game. Miniclip may in its sole discretion restrict or vary the type of Premium Items available to you based on your country of residence.</p>
<p>All Credits will, upon purchase or allocation, be allocated to the associated Miniclip account through which the purchase or allocation is made. Credits allocated to an account shall not in any circumstances be transferred between accounts, or between you and any other person save for Miniclip SA authorized and enabled transfers between Games. It is strictly prohibited to transfer or attempt to transfer Credits between two or more accounts in any way. You shall not transfer Credits between accounts by any means that attempts to bypass normal playing rules or that is contrary to the general purpose of a Miniclip Game (for example: by using one account to intentionally loose a Miniclip Game to another account for the purpose of transferring credits between the accounts). It is strictly prohibited to use multiple accounts to hold and use Credits in any manner that is contrary to the general purpose of a Miniclip Game. It is strictly prohibited to sell an account or any Credits to any person.</p>
<p>Miniclip SA may from time to time limit the use of Credits, including applying limits to the number of Credits allocated to your account at any time, and/or the number of Credits redeemable within a given time period.</p>
<h3>AUTOMATIC EXPIRY OF CREDITS</h3>
<p>The balance of unused Credits on your account will automatically expire, and be deleted from your account, if there has been no Credit-related activity on your account for a 12 month period. Credit-related activity means the purchase of new Credits or acquisition of Premium Items using Credits.</p>
<h3>SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF YOUR ACCOUNT</h3>
<p>Miniclip SA reserves the right to suspend or terminate your account if Miniclip SA or its designated payment processor is unable to verify or authenticate any information (including payment information) you provide in connection with the purchase or use of the relevant Credits, or is notified of or reasonably suspects fraudulent, abusive or other unlawful activity whatsoever in relation to your account or Credits balance, or if you are otherwise in breach of these Terms or any other applicable Terms and Conditions of Miniclip SA.</p>
<p>If your account has been suspended or terminated, you will (temporarily or permanently, as applicable) loose some or all of the balance of Credits on your account. In such an event you agree that you are not entitled to any reimbursement or refund of any payment for Credits, or any other compensation, except at the sole discretion of Miniclip SA.</p>
Please notify Miniclip SA immediately if you dispute a transaction for Credits or believe that any transaction occurring on your account is unauthorized.
<h3>LIABILITY</h3>
<p>You accept that your purchase or attempted purchase of Credits and use of credits within Miniclip Games is entirely at your own risk. Your only remedy for a technical failure or interruption of service in connection with a purchase of Credits is to request that your transaction be completed at a later time. To the fullest extent permissible by applicable law, Credits are provided on an "as is" and "as available" and without warranties of any kind either expressed or implied.</p>
<p>You are responsible for and agree to reimburse Miniclip SA for all reversals, charge-backs, claims, fees, fines, penalties and other liability incurred by it (including costs and related expenses) that were caused by or arising out of payments that you authorized or accepted, or which otherwise relate to any misuse of Credits by you.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in these terms shall exclude or restrict the liability of Miniclip SA for death or personal injury caused by its negligence or for any other liability which cannot be excluded or restricted under applicable law.</p>
